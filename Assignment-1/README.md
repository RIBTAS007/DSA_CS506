# Data Structures and Algorithms (CS506)
## Lab Assignment 1

1.  Write a C program to find the average and standard deviation of given any n numbers. The program first ask the user the number n, and then takes n
numbers. The program then computes and prints the average and standard deviation of the n numbers.

2.  Write a C function to count and print the number of 1-bits in its integer argument. Again your program should ask the user to enter an integer number.Your program should run correctly regardless of the machine.Hint: The given integer can be a negative number as well. The C programming language uses 2â€™s complement to represent an integer.
  
3.  In a Fibonacci sequence the sum of two successive terms gives the next term and the first three terms of the Fibonacci sequence are 0, 1, 1. Write a C function
to display the first n numbers of a Fibonacci sequence. Here, n is a positive integer entered through keyboard.

4.  Write a C-program to compute and print the range of the following data types.By range we mean the minimum and the maximum values that can be stored in the variable of the corresponding data type.
* char
* unsigned char
* int
* unsigned int
* sort
* unsigned sort
